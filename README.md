# Docker Configuration Files

This repository is a collection of `docker-compose` configuration files. Some of those are for
local use and others with URLs. The latter ones need a reverse-proxy. I use
[Traefik](https://gitlab.com/lazymedia/docker-configs/-/tree/master/traefik), so make sure
you use it as well. Otherwise, those configuration files won't work without further tweaking.
